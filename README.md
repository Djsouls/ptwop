All this would probably be a lot easier using a decent existing framework, but think sometimes it's kinda nice.

## Usage:
`python peer.py --listen 5000` to create a Peer listening for connections in port 5000 and `python peer.py --connect-to 5000` to create a Peer connected with a peer with port 5000 running locally
